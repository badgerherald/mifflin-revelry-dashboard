The Badger Herald Mifflin-Revelry Dashboard
===========================================

A slightly-polished version of the code that ran the [Mifflin-Revelry Dashboard app](http://badgerherald.com/mifflin/).

Things it might be nice to do
-----------------------------

- [x] Modularize server-side code
- [ ] Refactor the bad parts of the client-side JS
- [ ] Remove internal references to Mifflin or Revelry 
- [ ] Add a branch for the static version of the page
- [ ] Tests
